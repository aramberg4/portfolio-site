                        <p>I am a software engineer at Lamps.com - an online retailer for all things lighting. I graduated from Drexel University with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Informatics and a keen interest in data. I have had two co-ops while studying at Drexel. The first as a proprietary trade support developer at Susquehanna International Group, a High Frequency Trade Firm in Bala Cynwyd, PA. The other as a production application support developer at Brandywine Global, an asset management firm right in Philadelphia. I like playing squash, building computers, reading, watching football and (of course) coding. </p>

                        <p>The purpose of this website is mainly to consolidate all of my personal projects, professional experience and contact info all in one place for the convenience of anyone who is interested. Unfortunately, most work I have done at an enterprise level is proprietary and not available on GitHub. Please refer to my resume for contributions to enterprise projects.</p>
